Amy Fox is a data scientist driven by a lifelong love of puzzles and the challenge of finding clarity in complexity. Most recently, she worked as a Risk Analyst and Manager at Capital One, where she developed new credit data capabilities using tools like Python, SQL, and QuickSight. She recently took a sabbatical to explore new directions and deepen her technical skill set. Amy earned her PhD in 2021, where she built R-based data analysis pipelines to handle large-scale biological datasets and evaluate the efficacy of tuberculosis and SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in mice. She also served as a senior data scientist at an early-stage real estate technology startup, helping build a platform that uses data to connect people with their ideal neighborhoods. Across industries, her work is unified by a passion for uncovering insights through data and solving complex problems with creativity and precision.
