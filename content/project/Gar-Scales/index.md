It has been speculated that gar scales could have been used as arrow points in the Stone Age, especially in lithic-poor areas. I explored the usage and feasibility of gar scales as potential arrow points. I predicted that gar scales are feasible arrows point, and most will not break when used. To test this hypothesis, I shot a series of gar scale arrow points at an animal carcass using a calibrated cross bow. Based on my observations that the majority of the gar scales did not break and the fractures that did ensue usually occurred on the points with very thin serrated edges, my results can aid in the identification of potential alligator gar scale arrows at archeological sites. Through this project, I learned how to perform extensive literature searches on a neglected subject, execute a research project, and I wrote a paper that was published in the Journal of Houston Archeological Society.
