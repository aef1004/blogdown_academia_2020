      <description>&lt;p&gt;At Rice University, my senior design team developed an adjustable compression sock that is easier to don and doff. Chronic venous disorders (CVDs) affect 40% of the U.S. population, or 128 million people, in the United States alone. Out of the patients who are prescribed medical-grade compression socks, 63% do not wear them daily, because they are difficult to put on and uncomfortable to wear. Our goal was to develop a durable, comfortable compression sock that can be easily donned and delivers the necessary amount of pressure to mitigate the effects of CVD and reduce patient noncompliance. Our technology utilizes a clutch reel and corset-lacing so that it is easily wearable, comfortable, and delivers the necessary pressure. We obtained IRB approval and tested our compression sock on patients from 50-60 years old. We received many awards through presenting our design at many showcases and poster presentations, and ultimately submitted a patent for our design.&lt;/p&gt;
